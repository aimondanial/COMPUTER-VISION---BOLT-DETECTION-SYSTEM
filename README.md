This Computer Vision are developed using YOLOv8, which is an algorithm made using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The computer visiona are able to detect bolt with mAP@50 score at 88.88% and it was tested with real railway fishplate bolt using real time inferencing and it manage to achieve 86% of confidence score in average when tested with 36 unseen bolt from an actual railway. this project is part of my Final Year Project (FYP), which the title is to develop a Robot Arm for Fishplate Tightening in Railway Automation
